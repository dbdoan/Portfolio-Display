# Portfolio website

## About

Utilizing my growing skillset to create a portfolio website utilizing vanilla html/css/js.

Project display is modular and pulls data from my self-hosted Strapi database.
While the overall site is fundamentally beginner-esque and simple, I improved quite substantially.
I am looking forward to improving this portfolio project as my growth continues.

## Future Additions
[Updated: 03-14-25]
~~- Add project previews to the project display bar~~ [scraped, did not look good]
- Utiize Clash of Clans / Apex Legends API to display personal stats
- Top navigation bar
