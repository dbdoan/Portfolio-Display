# Portfolio website

## About

Utilizing my growing skillset as I progress through the OdinPproject to build my first website.

Project display is modular and pulls data from my self-hosted Strapi database.
While the overall site is fundamentally beginner-esque and simple, I improved quite substantially on the flexbox component of CSS which I am very content about.

Future Additions:
- Add project previews to the blue project display bar.
