# Portfolio DIsplay

## About

This is my personal portfolio site built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's simple by design but serves as a space to showcase my growth as a developer.

Projects are displayed dynamically using data from my self-hosted Strapi CMS, giving the site a modular and easily updatable structure. While the current version reflects my early learning phase, it's a work in progress — and I’m excited to evolve it as my skills continue to grow.

## Roadmap
- [x] Re-develop or improve About-Me portion
- [ ] Re-develop project display slots to be modular; SQL-based server for slot filling
- [ ] Rework social media icons; Replace current png's with svg's; Add hover glow
- [ ] Rework all px to rem/% for better scalability between platforms
- [ ] Update/Rework interests
- [ ] Spotify Song Showcase w/ icons?
- [ ] System Light/Dark mode color scheme improvements
