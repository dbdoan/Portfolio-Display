utilizing my growing skillset as i progress through the odin project to build my portfolio website.

project display is modular and pulls data from my self-hosted (sql) strapi database.

while the overall site is fundamentally beginner friendly and simple, i improved quite substantially on the flexbox component of css which i am very content about.

future additions:
- add project previews to the blue project display bar.
- improve on spacing
