# Portfolio website

## About

Utilizing my growing skillset as I progress through the Odin Project to build my first website.

Project display is modular and pulls data from my self-hosted Strapi database.
While the overall site is fundamentally beginner-esque and simple, I improved quite substantially.
I am looking forward to improving this portfolio project as my growth continues.

## Future Additions
- Add project previews to the project display bar
