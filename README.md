utilizing my skillset as i progress through the odin project to build my personal portfolio website.

projects display is modular and pulls data from my self-hosted (sql) strapi database.

while the overall site is fundamentally beginner-esque, i improved quite a lot on the flexbox component of css which i am really happy about.

future additions:
- add project previews to the blue project display bar.
- improve on spacing
